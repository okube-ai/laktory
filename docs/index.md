<img src="images/logo_sg.png" alt="laktory logo" width="85"/>

An open-source DataOps and dataframe-centric ETL framework for building 
lakehouses.

## What is it?
Laktory is your all-in-one solution for defining both data transformations and 
Databricks resources. Imagine if Terraform, Databricks Asset Bundles, and dbt
combined forces and added support for DataFrame API—that’s essentially Laktory.

This open-source framework streamlines the creation, deployment, and execution
of data pipelines while adhering to essential DevOps practices such as version
control, code reviews, and CI/CD integration. Powered by Narwhals, Laktory
enables seamless transitions between Apache Spark, Polars, and other frameworks
to perform data transformations reliably and at scale. Its modular and flexible
design allows you to effortlessly combine SQL statements with DataFrame
operations, reducing complexity and enhancing productivity.

#TODO UPDATE DIAGRAM TO INCLUDE NARWHALS
<img src="images/laktory_diagram.png" alt="what is laktory" width="800"/>

Since Laktory pipelines are built on top of Narwhals, they can run in
any environment that supports python—from your local machine to a Kubernetes 
cluster. They can also be deployed and orchestrated as Databricks Jobs or
[Delta Live Tables](https://www.databricks.com/product/delta-live-tables),
offering a simple, fully managed, and low-maintenance solution.

But Laktory goes beyond data pipelines. It empowers you to define and deploy 
your entire Databricks data platform—from Unity Catalog and access grants
to compute and quality monitoring—providing a complete, modern solution
for data platform management.

## Why Laktory?
Laktory is designed to accelerate value generation and reduce the total cost of
operations by focusing on four key areas: simplicity, speed, scalability and
quality.

### Simplicity
With Laktory, managing both Databricks resources and data transformations is 
streamlined into a single tool. This empowers your data team to take full 
ownership of the solution, eliminating the need to juggle multiple technologies.
Say goodbye to relying on external Terraform experts to handle compute, workspace
configuration, and Unity Catalog, while your data engineers and analysts try 
to combine Databricks Asset Bundles and dbt to build data pipelines. Laktory
consolidates these functions, simplifying the entire process and reducing
the overall cost.

### Speed
Adopting a [DataOps](concepts/dataops.md) approach and writing data pipelines as code enables faster,
more reliable production releases. With Laktory, you can run and debug your
pipelines directly from your favorite IDE before deploying to Databricks,
allowing for rapid iteration. With Laktory taking care of read, write and DAG
generation, you can concentrate on what matters most—business logic and creating
value—while minimizing boilerplate code.

### Scalability
Scale the right job to the right level. Run on a powerful Spark cluster when 
dealing with large datasets, or experiment locally with Polars on your machine
with smaller ones. Switching between environments is effortless with a simple
configuration change, ensuring that Laktory adapts to both small and 
large-scale needs without complexity.

### Quality
Elevate data quality to a first-class citizen. Laktory integrates robust data 
quality expectations at both row and aggregate levels, ensuring that only 
trusted data reaches production analytics. Invalid records can trigger pipline
failure, be dropped, or automatically quarantined for later review.

## Who is using it?
A growing number of [businesses](users.md) rely on Laktory to build, deploy, and scale 
their lakehouses with confidence.

## How does it work?
Using YAML configuration files or python code, define a [stack](concepts/stack.md) of
resources, such as a data [pipelines](concepts/pipeline.md) with SQL-based and
Spark-based transformations.

### Declare

=== "YAML"
    
    ```yaml title="pipeline_node.yaml"
    name: slv_stock_prices
    dataframe_backend: PYSPARK
    source:
      path: /Volumes/dev/sources/landing/tables/brz_stock_prices/

## Who is it for?
Laktory is built by data engineers for data engineers. 
It does not have visual interface nor allow you to setup pipelines with a few clicks and some drag and drop.
On the other hand, if you have minimal DevOps or programming experience, you will be able to efficiently scale, deploying hundreds of datasets and models without compromising data governance.
It also provides you with the tools for building a UI within your organization for a fully self-served experience.
