"Using Laktory to build, deploy and version our Databricks workspace artifacts has been
a game changer. Deploying workflows was always a pain point for our team as we 
maintained lengthy json code and used in-house scripting for deployment. Using YAML to
determine node dependencies, we no longer have to deal with complex json workflow code.
With Laktory, we can focus on our pipelinesâ€™ transformation logic and leave all the
boilerplate tasks up to the framework. This in turn streamlines our pipeline 
development and increases our sprint velocity."

"We have used Laktory on a couple of projects so far and in my opinion it was a step
change when it comes to enhancing developer experience on Databricks. Managing 
Databricks resources and ETL pipelines across multiple workspaces through a simple yaml
config without having to wrestle with Terraform was an absolute game changer. 
Personally, I recommend Laktory to all teams who are building on Databricks, especially
if you want to seamlessly manage your infrastructure and transformations through code. 
Overall, Laktory enables data teams to be more self-reliant when it comes to managing
their infrastructure."
