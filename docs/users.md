"We have used Laktory on a couple of projects so far and in my opinion it was a step
change when it comes to enhancing developer experience on Databricks. Managing 
Databricks resources and ETL pipelines across multiple workspaces through a simple yaml
config without having to wrestle with Terraform was an absolute game changer. 
Personally, I recommend Laktory to all teams who are building on Databricks, especially
if you want to seamlessly manage your infrastructure and transformations through code. 
Overall, Laktory enables data teams to be more self-reliant when it comes to managing
their infrastructure."
