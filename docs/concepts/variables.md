# Variables and Expressions

When declaring models in Laktory, it's not always practical, desirable, or even possible to hardcode certain properties. For example, the catalog name in a pipeline declaration might depend on the deployment environment. In many cases, you'll also want to share properties across multiple objects. Laktory introduces **model variables** to solve this problem.

## Syntax

To use a variable, follow this syntax: `${vars.VARIABLE_NAME}`.

## Declaration

### From Model
Any object declared with Laktory can receive variables as part of its data model:

```yaml title="cluster.yaml"
name: cluster-${vars.env}
size: ${vars.cluster_size}
variables:
  env: prd
  cluster_size: 2
```

When resolved:

- `name` becomes `cluster-prd`.
- `size` becomes `2`.

### From Environment
When resolving a variable, Laktory first searches for declared model variables. If not found, it falls back to environment variables.

### From CLI
Injecting variables via the CLI is **not currently supported**, but this feature will be available in the future.

## Properties

### Case Sensitivity
All variables are **case-insensitive**.

### Inheritance
Models inherit variables from their parent. They can also declare new variables or override parent variables.

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
jobs:
  - name: pipeline-${vars.env}
    tasks:
      - name: ingest
        cluster:
          size: ${vars.cluster_size}
      - name: process
        cluster:
          size: ${vars.cluster_size}
  - name: export-${vars.env}
    tasks:
      - name: export
        cluster:
          size: ${vars.cluster_size}
    variables:
      cluster_size: 1
variables:
  env: prd
  cluster_size: 2
```

In this example:

- `pipeline-prd` tasks use clusters of size `2`.
- `export-prd` tasks use clusters of size `1` due to the local override of `cluster_size`.

### Nesting
Variables can reference other variables:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
jobs:
  - name: pipeline-${vars.env}
    tasks:
      - name: ${task_prefix}-ingest
      - name: ${task_prefix}-process
    variables:
      task_prefix: ${user}-${env}
providers:
  databricks:
    host: ${vars.databricks_host}
variables:
  env: prd
  user: laktory
  databricks_host: ${vars.DATABRICKS_HOST_DEV}
```

Results:

- Task names: `laktory-prd-ingest` and `laktory-prd-process`.
- `databricks_host` resolves to the environment variable `DATABRICKS_HOST_DEV`.

## Types

### Simple
Supports `int`, `float`, `string`, and `boolean`.

### Complex
Supports complex objects like lists and dictionaries:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
jobs:
  - name: pipeline-${vars.env}
    tasks:
      - name: ingest
        cluster: ${vars.default_cluster}
      - name: ${task_prefix}-process
        cluster: ${vars.default_cluster}
    tags: ${vars.job_tags}
variables:
  env: dev
  job_tags:
    - laktory
    - poc
  default_cluster:
    name: default-cluster
    size: 2
```

Here:

- `job_tags` is a list of tags.
- `default_cluster` defines reusable cluster configurations.

### Regex
For advanced substitutions, use regex patterns:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
cluster:
  - name: ${custom_prefix.catalog.schema}
variables:
  r"\$\{custom_prefix\.(.*?)\}": r"${\1}"
```

Resolving the cluster name yields `catalog.schema`.

## Expressions

Use `${{ PYTHON_EXPRESSION }}` for dynamic attribute values:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
cluster:
  - name: pipeline-${vars.env}
    size: ${{ 4 if vars.env == 'prd' else 2 }}
variables:
  env: prd
```

Here, `size` evaluates to `4`. Any valid inline python expression is supported.

You can also use variables as dictionary keys:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
cluster:
  - name: pipeline-${vars.env}
    size: ${{ vars.sizes[vars.env] }}
variables:
  env: prd
  sizes:
    dev: 2
    prd: 4
```

## Special Cases

### Pipeline Nodes
When defining SQL transformations, Laktory allows referencing:

- The previous nodeâ€™s DataFrame using `{df}`.
- Specific nodes using `{nodes.node_name}`.

Example:

```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  {df} 
UNION 
  SELECT * FROM {nodes.node_01} 
UNION 
  SELECT * FROM {nodes.node_02}
```

### Resources
Variables can reference deployed resource outputs:

```yaml title="stack.yaml"
name: my-job-${vars.env}
tasks:
  - task_key: pipeline
    pipeline_task:
      pipeline_id: ${resources.my-pipeline.id}
```

Here:

- `pipeline_id` dynamically references `my-pipeline`'s ID.

**Note:** Resource variables are automatically populated by Laktory based on the selected IaC backend (Pulumi or Terraform). The resource must be deployed as part of the current stack.

## Variable Injection

??? "API Documentation"
    [`laktory.models.BaseModel.inject_vars`][laktory.models.BaseModel]<br>

Variables are injected during deployment, typically after serialization (`model_dump`). However, you can manually trigger injection using `job.inject_vars()`.
